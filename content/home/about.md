# About Me

My name is Fragapane Victoria. I'm 19 years old and I live in Belgium. I am student at the University of Mons in Belgium and I do my second year of my bachelor in Biology. 

During my high school, I went to APMW in Morlanwelz and I did a cursus based on Mathematics and Sciences. I was graduated on June 2017.

Later I have for project to be a teacher of Biology in high school.
